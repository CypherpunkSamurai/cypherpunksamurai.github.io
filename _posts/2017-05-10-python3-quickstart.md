# v_01 - > Python3 - Quickstart

Python3 is quickly gaining speed at popularity. I will try to cover basics of python3 quick and fast as possible. Python is quite easy to understand and code because of its syntax. It's got a lot of public modules already for different uses. It's fun coding in python :grin:

## Installation
Installing python3 differs for each os. Windows, MacOS and Linux have their own way of installation. Most Linux distro's probably would already have it preinstalled.

### Installation on windows
